He uses it to threaten and entry on the far leg but the defender brings their other arm down to stop it. Diego follows up with an arm saddle grip to transition into a choi bar. The choi bar is failing so he goes back into the legs, spinning the leg to enter cross ashi.",0,2025-04-08T18:05:25.320685

Our goal as the passer is generally to manipulate this leg by: 1) Getting our body in between their legs to split their legs apart (often leading to body lock scenarios.) 2) Smash their legs together. 3) Extension using something like a knee hike...",1,2025-04-08T18:05:25.321525

As the top player, to get around the knee shield, we can post on their shoulder and their shin as we step over their knee shield leg putting ourselves in a butterfly half guard. Then, we switch sides and shuffle our feet as we leg drag their knee shield leg. If at any time the bo...",2,2025-04-08T18:05:25.322176

This allows us to make our strangle arm as long as possible. We use our hooks to create this effect by switching sides.

Niko sprawls to defend giving Jed the ability to take an underhook and use it to wrestle up with a single leg to complete the sweep.

Knowing this, we can take a tombstone grip to make it difficult for the defender to turn away from us.
